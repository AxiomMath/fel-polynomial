# Fel's conjecture on syzygies of numerical semigroups

These files accompany the paper [arXiv:2602.03716](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03716).

The formal proofs provided in this work were developed and verified using **Lean 4.26.0**. Compatibility with earlier or later versions is not guaranteed due to the evolving nature of the Lean 4 compiler and its core libraries.

## Input files

- `Fel_Conjecture.tex`: natural language problem statement
- `task.md`: description of the task to be completed (deferring to `Fel_Conjecture.tex`)
- `.environment`: specifies the Lean version

## Output files (Run with Lean 4.26.0)

- `FelConjecture/problem.lean`: translation of the problem statement into formal language (Lean)
- `FelConjecture/solution.lean`: solution in formal language (Lean)

## Miscellaneous files (not used or written by AxiomProver)

- `examples.sage`: used to verify the worked examples in the paper's exposition
